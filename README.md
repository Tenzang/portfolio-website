# Portolio Site

## Description

This is the source code for my portfolio site where you can find out more about me and my projects.

_Visit the site [here](loden-gendun.com)._

## Lessons Learned

This site was originally written from scratch just using plain _HTML_, _CSS_ & _Javascript_ which was a good exercise but recently I decided to remake it using _Gatsby_. I love learning new skills and picking up new tools, and the site had a lot of repeated elements so it was a good idea to redesign my portfolio in a way that would allow me to quickly and easily expand it.

Overall I've really enjoyed the Gatsby development experience.

## Acknowledgements

Special shoutout to [Lindenegs gatsby-material-typescript-starter](https://github.com/Lindeneg/gatsby-material-typescript-starter) for helping me to overcome the dependency conflict hell I was in and dive right into building this site.
